## Description

June L’s Web Developer Portfolio is a showcase of my work as a full-stack web developer. This single-page application highlights my skills in modern web development technologies and features various projects that demonstrate my proficiency in creating dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. The portfolio is designed with React.js and styled using Chakra UI, providing a seamless and visually appealing experience.

Each project in the portfolio includes links to live deployed versions and GitHub repositories, allowing visitors to explore the code and functionality. The portfolio also includes an About Me section with a brief introduction, a downloadable resume, and links to my professional social media profiles. The Contact section allows visitors to reach out directly, making this portfolio both a professional showcase and a networking tool.
